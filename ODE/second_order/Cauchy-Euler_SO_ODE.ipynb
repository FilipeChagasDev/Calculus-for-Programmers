    "# Cauchy-Euler Second Order ODE - Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "An Cauchy-Euler second order ODE has the following format:\n",
    "    \n",
    "$$x^2 \\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + px \\frac{dy}{dx} + qy(x)=0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Equation's Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The general solution $y(x)$ for this type of equation is a linear combination of two fundamental solutions $y_1(x)$ and $y_1(x)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y(x) = c_1y_1(x) + c_2y_2(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are constants that must be found by solving de initial value problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way of solving Cauchy-Euler second order ODE is assuming the trial solution $y(x)=x^m$. For that, we have $y'(x)=mx^{m-1}$ and $y''(x)=m(m-1)x^{m-2}$, where $m$ is a constant that we must find.\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting $y(x)$ and its derivatives in the equation, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x^2[m(m-1)x^{m-2}] + px(mx^{m-1}) + qx^m = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying the distributive property, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m^2 x^2 x^{m-2} - m x^2 x^{m-2} + px(mx^{m-1}) + qx^m = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying $x^{a-b} = x^a/x^b$, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m^2 \\frac{x^2 x^m}{x^2} - m \\frac{x^2 x^m}{x^2} + pmx \\frac{x^m}{x} + qx^m = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplifying:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m^2 x^m - m x^m + pm x^m + qx^m = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting $x^m$ in evidence:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x^m[m^2 + m(p-1) + q] = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that for $x \\neq 0$ there is no $m \\in \\mathbb{C}$ which satisfacts $x^m = 0$, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m^2 + m(p-1) + q = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying the quadratic formula, we have $m_1 = \\frac{1 -p + \\sqrt{\\Delta}}{2}$ and $m_2 = \\frac{1 -p - \\sqrt{\\Delta}}{2}$, where $\\Delta = (p-1)^2 - 4q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fundamental and General Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental solutions  $y_1(x)$  and  $y_2(x)$  need to be linearly independent. This linear independence can be verified by the Wronskian. The characteristc equation can have two real roots, one real root or two complex roots, and there are a pair of fundamentally linearly independent solutions for each of these cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Case $\\Delta > 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, $m_1, m_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $m_1 \\neq m_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental solutions are $y_1(x)=x^{m_1}$ and, $y_2(x)=x^{m_2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general solution is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y(x) = c_1 x^{m_1} + c_2 x^{m_2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $c_1, c_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Case $\\Delta = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, $m = m_1 = m_2$ and $m \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental solutions are $y_1(x)=x^{m}\\ln(x)$ and, $y_2(x)=x^{m}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general solution is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y(x) = c_1 x^{m} \\ln(x) + c_2 x^{m}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $c_1, c_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Case $\\Delta < 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, $m_1, m_2 \\in \\mathbb{C}$. These roots are $m_1 = \\alpha + \\beta i$ and $m_2 = \\alpha - \\beta i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental solutions are $y_1(x)=x^{m_1}$ and, $y_2(x)=x^{m_2}$. Applying $x^{a+b} = x^ax^b$, $e^{\\ln x} = x$ and $(x^a)^b = x^{ab}$, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_1(x) = x^{m_1} = x^{\\alpha + \\beta i} = x^{\\alpha}x^{\\beta i} = x^{\\alpha}(e^{\\ln x})^{\\beta i} = x^{\\alpha} e^{i\\beta \\ln x }$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "and\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_2(x) = x^{m_2} = x^{\\alpha - \\beta i} = x^{\\alpha}e^{-i\\beta  \\ln x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying Euler's indentity ($e^{i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta$), we have:\n",
